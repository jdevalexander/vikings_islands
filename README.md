# Vikings And Islands
The game in which you create a map of Islands. 
The Vikings land on the islands. 
After landing the war for the Islands begins.
The war lasts 10,000 days or until all the Islands or Vikings will be destroyed.  

Example of the map with islands:  
Island1 north=Island3 south=Island4 west=Island2 east=Island6  
Island2 east=Island1  
Island3 south=Island1  
Island4 north=Island1 east=Island5  
Island5 north=Island6 west=Island4  
Island6 west=Island1 south=Island5  

Configuration to run the application:  
You can run this app in your development environment (IDE).
Use: Java 8. Gradle 6.5.1  

When you run this app in your IDE, you'll need to enter the file path with map of islands.  
Example of the file path:  
C:\Program Files\vikings_examples\1.txt  

After that you'll need to enter number of vikings which will land on the islands.  
That's it. During 10000 steps you'll see log of movements of vikings and how they destroy islands.

Enjoy my app and may the kitties be with you!
